# hello-world
getting started
this is my first venture into git stuff.  i'm exploring how it works, so I can decide if/where/how to use it.
Rather than play with code, I'm just making changes to this ReadMe file.  It will demonstrate commits, so I can see how to access them and what I can do with them.
